# XSS Payloads

## Obfuscation

Some sites make use of string filters to "detect" xss attacks. For example, they scan the input for string containing keywords like `script` or even `alert`
(the later one is kinda funny, as it's more used for reconnaissance and blocking only this would still allow to hack a site, lol).

### alert()

```js
top[(8680439).toString(30)](1337);
```

- `8680439..toString` - first dot is recognized as decimal point, second dot is recognized as invoking call to object which allows the call for `toString(base)`
- `.toString(30)` - convert to the base of `30`: numbers `0`..`9` + first 20 letters of the alphabet (until `t`, which is the highest letter of `alert`)
- `top['alert']` - selects the alert function from the `top` object (which is a reference to the top most `window` object)
- `alert(1337)` - final call
